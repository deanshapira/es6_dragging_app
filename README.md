An app implementing drag and drop in React, using Browserify and Babelify to transpile JSX and ES6 (and ES7) features. Actual javascript code comes from [ReactDnD Sortable example](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/tree/master/examples/04%20Sortable/Simple), I was just experimenting with getting it running on a Rails backend.
